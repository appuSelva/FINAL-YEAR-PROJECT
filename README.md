# FINAL-YEAR-PROJECT
The proposed project is a web-based platform designed to connect daily wage earners with potential clients, providing a direct and accessible way for workers to find employment opportunities. Many local laborers, such as electricians, plumbers, carpenters, painters, construction workers, and other skilled or unskilled workers, face challenges in securing regular work due to the absence of a structured hiring system. This platform serves as a bridge between clients and daily wage workers, enabling clients to search, sort, and directly contact workers based on their service type and location.
Key features of this system include a direct contact option, allowing clients to call or message workers without intermediaries, ensuring quick access to services and eliminating third-party commissions. A location-based sorting feature helps clients find the nearest available workers, ensuring convenience and efficiency in hiring. To facilitate better communication, the platform includes a call feature, enabling clients and workers to discuss job details, availability, and pricing before finalizing the work. Additionally, to reduce the risk of fraudulent listings, the system ensures that only verified worker details are posted, making it a trustworthy platform for both workers and clients.
Technically, the platform is built with a secure and scalable database that ensures real-time updates and easy data management. The system is designed to handle efficient worker searches, user-friendly interactions, and seamless communication between clients and workers.
The primary goal of this project is to enhance job opportunities for daily wage earners by increasing their visibility and accessibility to clients. At the same time, it offers clients a budget-friendly and reliable solution to hire workers for their service needs. By removing middlemen and promoting direct worker-client interaction, this platform creates a fair, transparent, and efficient hiring system, benefiting both workers and service seekers.
